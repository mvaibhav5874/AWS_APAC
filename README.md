## REQUEST :- 
<p align="justify">
My name is Lilly Sawyer and I am the co-founder and CTO of Fastier, the online tool that makes organizing things fast. You may have seen that we have been in the news recently and have been experiencing some big growth as a result. Unfortunately, this means we’ve been having some difficulties with our website. The response times can be slow during peak periods and sometimes we even have server crashes when it runs out of memory. We also experience some downtime during deployments and don’t have a disaster recovery plan. Based on our current trajectory, we predict we’re going to see consistent linear growth for a while. Our application is a SPA React Application backed by Python and Flask, with PostgreSQL as a database. It all runs off a single AWS EC2 instance currently (t3.medium, 4GB of RAM). Can you design an architecture for us that will alleviate the problems we’re experiencing? We are not on a strict budget right now, but at the same time, it’s not unlimited.
